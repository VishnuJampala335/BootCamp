Boolean as a service
Setup Instructions:
Packages required to run the app:
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
go get github.com/jinzhu/gorm
go get github.com/rs/xid
Database : By default the app uses a local MySQL database with user credentials as shown below and intialised in the db.go file in the package dbConfig
var dbUserName = "root"
var dbPassword = ""
var dbName = "booldb"
The same can be modified if any changes to the credentials or the database are necessary
Instructions to run the API:
The API server is configured to listen to the port 8080

Authentication:
It is required for the user to authenticate him/herself to make any API calls. The API itself performs token based authentication with the help of cookies. The cookies expire after 5 minutes
Authentication needs to be performed using the below endpoint by passing the username and password in the JSON format
/login
By default it accepts the following credentials
username: "root"
password: "password"
Authenticated users can further add new users using the endpoint
/adduser
and supply the new username and password in JSON format
User can logout using the endpoint
/logout
Endpoints:
POST "/" 
Adds a new boolean to the database. Input JSON format expected is:

"value": true/false (If not supplied default is false)
"label": "Sample label"  (Optional)
GET "/:id"  
Extracts a boolean record (if it exists) from the database whose id matches the given input id

PATCH "/:id"
Updates the boolean record (if it exists) from the database whose id matches the given input id, using the information supplied in the JSON format:

"value":   (Optional)
"label":   (Optional)
DELETE "/:id"
Deletes a boolean record (if it exists) from the database whose id matches the given input id

Also note that sync.RWMutex has been used to synchronize database access.

Project Structure
The project has three packages (apart from main)

models
The models.go file in the models package consists of the definitions of various structs to be used to bind to user JSON input and/or define database schemas
controller
The controller package consists of logic to handle various endpoints and authentication
dbConfig
This package is used to handle database connection and configuration
